Change to standard library mechanism
------------------------------------
 - Keep all standard library code dev centralised in a single add in
 - Enable VBA import direct from add in 
  - Import triggers the below:
        * saves add in
        * exports add in code which can then be pushed to github
        * imports add in code into active workbook
 - Generally keep add in VBA output pushing to the dev branch?


Create ability to export code of all open workbooks

Reconfigure ribbon and save down copy so it is upladed to github

Need to branch back into main

General thought (across projects)
 - Create dev branches in all repos
 - Prevent accidental pushes to master as below:
