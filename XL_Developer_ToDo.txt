Create a new branch for below feature (new fork created)

Change to standard library mechanism
------------------------------------
 - Keep all standard library code dev centralised in a single add in
 - Enable VBA import direct from add in 
  - Import triggers the below:
        * saves add in
        * exports add in code which can then be pushed to github
        * imports add in code into active workbook
 - Generally keep add in VBA output pushing to the dev branch?
- Get rid of existing mechanism that imports raw github code



Change save of keyboard shortcut to a range name rather than saving on a sheet

General thought (across projects)
 - Create dev branches in all repos
 - Prevent accidental pushes to master as below:

Consider
 - Add a field to designate workbook as development
 * refresh libraries  on open
 * export VBA code on save
 * export standard libraries on save and push to github

Create ability to export code of all open workbooks

Create sub to create a to do Tab?
 -  rather than maintaining a seperate text to do sheet
 - include in code export
 - Maybe not as issue is that I will not be able to update todo easily from Dropbox on phone etc
