Consider change in standard code workflow - drive from various open projects and call github from command line rather than centralising?  Current state is a bit annoying but changing is a bit of work and makes harder to keep in sync
 --> file will need to be designated as a "standard library developer file"
 --> Map prefixes against repos
 --> Needs to push on file save
 --> Don't perform the git processes if the file is an add-in (which effectively means it is is production)
 --> shell ("git -C C:\Users\charl\Dropbox\Dropbox_Charl\Computer_Technical\Programming_GitHub\XL_Developer push origin main")
 --> Consider forking a dev branch to be used for auto pushes

General thought (across projects)
 - Create dev branches in all repos
 - Prevent accidental pushes to master as below:

Consider
 - Add a field to designate workbook as development
 * refresh libraries  on open
 * export VBA code on save
 * export standard libraries on save and push to github

Create ability to export code of all open workbooks

Create sub to create a to do Tab?
 -  rather than maintaining a seperate text to do sheet
 - include in code export
 - Maybe not as issue is that I will not be able to update todo easily from Dropbox on phone etc
 
 More  Visual Studio question but how do I work on different projects simaltaneously - what is a workspace?
